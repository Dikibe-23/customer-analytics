# E-COMMERCE CUSTOMER ANALYTICS
## About this project
An online business wants to improve its marketing strategy and would like to know how to tailor its strategy to specific customers to improve sales and customer retention.

In this customer analytics project, we will be carrying out analysis on the business data in order to study customer behaviour and deduce certain characteristics

## METHOD
We will utilize the power of segmentation to divide customers into subgroups based on their behavior and other types of shared characteristics. 

## BENEFITS OF THIS PROJECT
To mention a few ;

- The result of this analysis can be used for predictive modelling for instance, to predict customers who are likely to leave a business, or default in loan repayment etc.
- The result can as well be used for direct marketing, customer acquisition and customer relationship.
- It can be used to minimize cost on marketing expenditure whilst maximizing marketing strategy.

## TOOLS
- Python (Anaconda Jupyter Lab)

## STEPS
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Data cleaning (handling missing values etc.).
3. Data formatting.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
